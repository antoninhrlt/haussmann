Integrate highly customizable widgets and themes for any Rust application or GUI 
library

## Purpose
This project is not a GUI library itself, but it gives highly customizable 
widgets and themes to be integrated in a GUI library or directly in an 
application using a system API 
([windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs), 
[x11rb](https://github.com/psychon/x11rb), â€¦). Furthermore, the crate contains 
tools to transform widgets into shapes and to place and align widgets on a 
drawable surface. The [`Drawer`](src/graphics/drawer.rs) trait can be implemented on a drawable surface to 
easily draw widgets on it

## Usage
This project is under development and does not have any usage instructions at the moment.
