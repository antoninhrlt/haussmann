/// Creates a shape with `N` points and `N` borders.
/// 
/// ## Why a shape builder 
/// The purpose of this builder is to create a safe [`Shape`] object. Indeed, if 
/// the shape were proposing build functions itself, the user could define a 
/// structure with a different number of points than the borders or create a 
/// filled shape without a fill colour.
/// 
/// The question : "why not just using the const template argument `N` with 
/// [`Shape`]?" could be asked. And the answer would be: The [`Shape`] structure 
/// wants to be a sort of parent for all the type of shapes. Adding a `N` const 
/// template argument would not permit to have different sort of shapes in a 
/// same widget.
