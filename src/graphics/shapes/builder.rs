/// ## Why a shape builder 
/// The purpose of this builder is to create a safe `Shape` object. Indeed, if 
/// the shape were proposing build functions itself, the user could define a 
/// structure with a different number of points than the borders or create a 
/// filled shape without a fill colour.
/// 
/// > But, why not just using the const template argument `N` with `Shape` ?
/// 
/// The `Shape` structure wants to be a sort of parent for all the type of 
/// shapes. Adding a `N` const template argument would not permit to have 
/// different sort of shapes in a same widget.
