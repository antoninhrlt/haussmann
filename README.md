Integrate and create highly customizable widgets and themes for any Rust application or GUI library

## Purpose
This project is not a GUI library itself, but it gives highly customizable 
widgets and themes to be integrated in a GUI library or directly in an 
application using a system API 
([windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs), 
[x11rb](https://github.com/psychon/x11rb), â€¦). Furthermore, the crate contains 
tools to transform widgets into drawables, align and size them in a layout.

## Usage
This project is under development and does not have any usage instructions at 
the moment.
